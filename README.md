# uni_real_time_execution_lab5

This is a project, completed for the final practice of Echtzeitbetriebssystemen (Real-Time OS) course in Hochschule Merseburg (High School of Merseburg,   Germany). It is a rather simple project on C with the usage of FreeRTOS to implement synchronisation. Namely, a couple of semaphores, a queue, and a software timer are used.
The project simulates a facility of two scales, a water reservoir, and a mixer.
To use the project file, it should be cloned onto your device, and put into a FreeRTOS project.
The tasks are controlled by keyboard letters "e" (calls the recept) and "s" (starts the procedure).
